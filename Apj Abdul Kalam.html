The date 8th August 2013, has been marked as a land mark day in the history of Hills’ High School. It was an evening that has left a mark on each one of us…..
Dear Readers, Every achievement, every milestone crossed is only due to your support and love over the years. It is only through the blessings of our beloved students that such opportunities come our way.
<br><br>
We would as always like to share our experience of those memorable moments with you…. As we entered the room,
 we all wished Sir, with a strong “Vande Mataram “, to which he immediately stood up. He then asked each of 
our students their names and which standard they were from. He then spoke to each of the adults and then very
 patiently and precisely answered all our students’ questions….
