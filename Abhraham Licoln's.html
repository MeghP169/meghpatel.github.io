Abraham Licoln's Letter 
<br>to his Son's teacher
</font></center>
<font face="lucida handwriting" size="5"><center><br>
He will have to learn. I know, but teach him that for<br>
 every scoundrel there is a hero. Behind every selfish boy<br> 
there is a leader. I know it will take time but teach him<br>
 to learn to loose and also enjoy winning. Steer him <br>
from every bad behaviour if you can, teach him the <br>
secret of quiet laughter. Teach him if you can, the<br>
 wonder of books, teach him to laugh when he is sad. In<br> 
school teach him it is far more honourable to fail than <br>
to cheat. Teach him to be gentle with gentle people and <br>
be tough with the tough. Teach him there is no shame in<br>
 tears. Treat him gently, but do not cuddle him, because <br>
only the test of fire makes fine steel. Let him have the <br>
courage to be impatient but teach him to have the<br>
patience to be brave. Also teach him to learn from <br>
punishment and not repeat his mistakes ever again.<br>

This is a big order, but see what you can do. He is such <br>
a fine little fellow!!!
